# Task summaries' directory

This directory contains the summaries written for each laboratory.

The summary for a given laboratory should be put in a separate directory with the same name as the laboratory, i.e. for tasks in `dl_in_iot_course/l02_quantization` there should be a corresponding `summaries/l02_quantization` directory with the summary.

The summary can written either in .md format or PDF format (containing scan or rendered output) - the .md format is recommended due to better tracking in Git history.

The images enclosed in summaries should be present in the `summaries/<lab-name>/img` directories.
